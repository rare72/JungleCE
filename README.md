Jungle Computing Effort

Open Source is amazing. OSS is instrumental in so much in todays world. This repo is my attempt to create a normalized environment. This repo is where I would like to store my best efforts to create an environment that is stable that can also support many unsecure production systems. 

My overall plan is to move my work from my Kick Da Tires Repo into this repo once I have tested my creations.

Hope you enjoy!!!
